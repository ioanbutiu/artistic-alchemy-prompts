The simple act of imagining a dream in concrete detail helps us to bring it into reality. Think of your goal search as a preliminary architect\u2019s drawing for the life you would wish to have. I am indebted to Barbara Sher and Shakti Gawain for the inspiration for these tasks. The Steps \u25cb Name your dream. That\u2019s right. Write it down. \u201c In a perfect world. I would secretly love to be a ________________. \u201d \u25cb Name one concrete goal that signals to you its accomplishment. On your emotional compass. this goal signifies true north. (Note: two people may want to be an actress. They share that dream. For one. an article in People magazine is the concrete goal. To her. glamour is the emotional center for her dream ; glamour is true north. For the second actress. the concrete goal is a good review in a Broadway play. To her. respect as a creative artist is the emotional center of her dream ; respect is true north. Actress one might be happy as a soap star. Actress two would need stage work to fulfill her dream. On the surface. both seem to desire the same thing.) \u25cb In a perfect world. where would you like to be in five years in relation to your dream and true north ? \u25cb In the world we inhabit now. what action can you take. this year. to move you closer? \u25cb What action can you take this month? This week? This day? Right now? \u25cb List your dream (for example, to be a famous film director). List its true north (respect and higher consciousness. mass communication.) Select a role model (Walt Disney. Ron Howard. Michael Powell). Make an action plan. Five years. Three years. One year. One month. One week. Now. Choose an action. Reading this book is an action."
