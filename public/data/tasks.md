### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

List three old enemies of your creative self-worth. Please be as specific as possible in doing this exercise. Your historic monsters are the building blocks of your core negative beliefs. (Yes. rotten Sister Ann Rita from fifth grade does count. and the rotten thing she said to you does matter. Put her in.) This is your monster hall of fame. More monsters will come to you as you work through your recovery. It is always necessary to acknowledge creative injuries and grieve them. Otherwise. they become creative scar tissue and block your growth.

## Time Travel

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

Select and write out one horror story from your monster hall of fame. You do not need to write long or much, but do jot down whatever details come back to you — the room you were in, the way people looked at you, the way you felt, what your parent said or didn’t say when you told about it. Include whatever rankles you about the incident: 'And then I remember she gave me this real fakey smile and patted my head.'

## Letter to the Editor

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

Write a letter to the editor in your defense. It is great fun to write this letter in the voice of your wounded artist child: "To whom it may concern: Sister Ann Rita is a jerk and has pig eyes and I can too spell!"

## Time Travel

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

List three old champions of your creative self-worth. This is your hall of champions. Those who wish you and your creativity well. Be specific. Every encouraging word counts. Even if you disbelieve a compliment, record it. It may well be true. If you are stuck for compliments, go back through your time-travel log and look for positive memories. When, where, and why did you feel good about yourself? Who gave you affirmation? Additionally, you may wish to write the compliment out and decorate it. Post it near where you do your morning pages or on the dashboard of your car.

## Time Travel

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

Select and write out one happy piece of encouragement from someone who was your champion. Write a thank-you letter. Save it for yourself or send it to the long-lost mentor.

## Imaginary Lives

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

If you had five other lives to lead, what would you do in each of them? I would be a pilot, a cowhand, a physicist, a psychic, a monk. You might be a scuba diver, a cop, a writer of children’s books, a football player, a belly dancer, a country singer, a performance artist. Whatever occurs to you, jot it down. Do not overthink this exercise. The point of these lives is to have fun in them — more fun than you might be having in this one. Look over your list and select one. Then do it this week. For instance, if you put down country singer, can you pick a guitar? If you dream of being a cowhand, what about some horseback riding?

## Blurts into Affirmations

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

In working with affirmations and blurts, very often injuries and monsters come back to us. Make a list of 10 negative blurts as they occur to you. Work with each blurt individually. Turn each negative into an affirmative positive.

## Go on a walk

### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

Take your artist for a walk, the two of you. A brisk twenty-minute walk can dramatically alter consciousness.

<!-- Week 2 -->

## Revisit the Basic Principles

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

Post the Basic Principles somewhere you can see and read daily.

## Where does your time go?

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

List your five major activities this week. How much time did you give to each one? Which were what you wanted to do and which were shoulds? How much of your time is spent helping others and ignoring your own desires? Have any of your blocked friends triggered doubts in you?

Take a sheet of paper. Draw a circle. Inside that circle, place topics you need to protect. Place the names of those you find to be supportive. Outside the circle, place the names of those you must be self-protective around just now. Place this safety map near where you write your morning pages. Use this map to support your autonomy. Add names to the inner and outer spheres as appropriate: “Oh! Derek is somebody I shouldn’t talk to about this right now.”

## Make a List

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

List twenty things you enjoy doing (rock climbing, roller - skating, baking pies, making soup, riding a bike, riding a horse, playing catch. shooting baskets, and so forth). When was the last time you let yourself do these things? Next to each entry, place a date. Don’t be surprised if it’s been years for some of your favorites. That will change. This list is an excellent resource for artist dates.

## Pick Two Goals

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

Write down two favorite things that you’ve avoided that could be this week’s goals. These goals can be small: buy one roll of film and shoot it. Remember, we are trying to win you some autonomy with your time. Look for windows of time just for you. and use them in small creative acts. Get to the record store at lunch hour, even if only for fifteen minutes. Stop looking for big blocks of time when you will be free. Find small bits of time instead.

## Revisit your Affirmations

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

Dip back into Week One and read the affirmations. Note which ones cause the most reaction. Often the one that sounds the most ridiculous is the most significant. Write three chosen affirmations five times each day in your morning pages; be sure to include the affirmations you made yourself from your blurts.

## Imaginary Lives

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

Make a list of five imaginary lives you'd like to lead. Check to see if you could be doing bits and pieces of these lives in the one you are living now. If you have listed a dancer’s life. do you let yourself go dancing? If you have listed a monk’s life. are you ever allowed to go on a retreat? If you are a scuba diver, is there an aquarium shop you can visit? A day at the lake you could schedule?

## Life Pie

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

Draw a circle. Divide it into six pieces of pie. Label one piece spirituality, another exercise, another play, and so on with work, friends, and romance / adventure. Place a dot in each slice at the degree to which you are fulfilled in that area (outer rim indicates great; inner circle. not so great). Connect the dots. This will show you where you are lopsided. As you begin the course, it is not uncommon for your life pie to look like a tarantula. As recovery progressesm, your tarantula may become a mandala. Working with this tool, you will notice that there are areas of your life that feel impoverished and on which you spend little or no time. Use the time tidbits you are finding to alter this.

## Ten Tiny Changes

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

List ten changes you’d like to make for yourself, from the significant to the small or vice versa (“ get new sheets so I have another set, go to China, paint my kitchen, dump my bitchy friend Alice ”). Do it this way:

I would like to...

I would like to...

As the morning pages nudge us increasingly into the present. where we pay attention to our current lives. a small shift like a newly painted bathroom can yield a luxuriously large sense of self-care.

## Set a Goal

### Week 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity

Select one small item and make it a goal for this week. Now do that item.

<!-- Week 3 -->

## Childhood Room

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

Describe your childhood room. If you wish, you may sketch this room. What was your favorite thing about it? What’s your favorite thing about your room right now? Nothing? Well, get something you like in there — maybe something from that old childhood room.

## Chilhood Traits

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

Describe five traits you like in yourself as a child.

## Childhood Accomplishments

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

List five childhood accomplishments. (straight A’s in seventh grade. trained the dog. punched out the class bully. short - sheeted the priest’s bed). And a treat: list five favorite childhood foods. Buy yourself one of them this week. Yes. Jell-O with bananas is okay.

## Habits

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

Take a look at your habits. Many of them may interfere with your self-nurturing and cause shame. Some of the oddest things are self-destructive. Do you have a habit of watching TV you don’t like? Do you have a habit of hanging out with a really boring friend and just killing time? Some rotten habits are overt (drinking too much. smoking. eating instead of writing). List three obvious rotten habits. What’s the payoff in continuing them? Some rotten habits are more subtle (no time to exercise. little time to pray. always helping others. not getting any self-nurturing. hanging out with people who belittle your dreams). List three of your subtle foes. What use do these forms of sabotage have? Be specific.

## Nurturing Friends

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

Make a list of friends who nurture you — that’s nurture (give you a sense of your own competency and possibility). not enable (give you the message that you will never get it straight without their help). There is a big difference between being helped and being treated as though we are helpless. List three nurturing friends. Which of their traits serve you well?

## Call a friend

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

Call a friend who treats you like you are a really good and bright person who can accomplish things. Part of your recovery is reaching out for support. This support will be critical as you undertake new risks.

## Inner Compass

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

Each of us has an inner compass. This is an instinct that points us toward health. It warns us when we are on dangerous ground. Morning pages are one way to contact it. So are some other artist-brain activities — painting. driving. walking. scrubbing. running. This week, take an hour to follow your inner compass by doing an artist-brain activity and listening to what insights bubble up.

## People You Admire

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

List five people you admire. Now. list five people you secretly admire. What traits do these people have that you can cultivate further in yourself?
List five people you wish you had met who are dead. Now, list five people who are dead whom you’d like to hang out with for a while in eternity. What traits do you find in these people that you can look for in your friends?
Compare the two sets of lists. Take a look at what you really like and really admire — and a look at what you think you should like and admire. Your shoulds might tell you to admire Edison while your heart belongs to Houdini. Go with the Houdini side of you for a while.

## Detective Work, An Exercise

### Week 3: Recovering a Sense of Power

A little sleuth work is in order to restore the persons we have abandoned — ourselves. When you complete the following phrases, you may feel strong emotion as you retrieve memories and misplaced fragments of yourself. Allow yourself to free-associate for a sentence or so with each phrase.

## Time Travel

### Week 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity

## Time Travel

### Week 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity

Remember yourself at eight. What did you like to do? What were your favorite things? Now. write a letter from you at eight to you at your current age. What would you tell yourself?

## Environment

### Week 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity

Look at your house. Is there any room that you could make into a secret. private space for yourself? Convert the TV room? Buy a screen or hang a sheet and cordon off a section of some other room? This is your dream area. It should be decorated for fun and not as an office. All you really need is a chair or pillow. something to write on. some kind of little altar area for flowers and candles. This is to help you center on the fact that creativity is a spiritual, not an ego, issue.

## Take it Easy

### Week 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity

Growth must have time to solidify into health. One day at a time, you are building the habit patterns of a healthy artist. Easy does do it. List ongoing self-nurturing toys you could buy your artist:
books on tap, magazine subscriptions, theater tickets, a bowling ball.

## Buried Dreams, An Exercise

### Week 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity

As recovering creatives. we often have to excavate our own pasts for the shards of buried dreams and delights. Do a little digging. please. Be fast and frivolous. This is an exercise in spontaneity, so be sure to write your answers out quickly. Speed kills the Censor.

List five hobbies that sound fun.

List five classes that sound fun.

List five things you personally would never do that sound fun.

List five skills that would be fun to have.

List five things you used to enjoy doing.

List five silly things you would like to try once.

## Reading Deprivation, An Exercise

### Week 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity

Reading deprivation casts us into our inner silence. a space some of us begin to immediately fill with new words — long, gossipy conversations, television bingeing, the radio as a constant, chatty companion. We often cannot hear our own inner voice, the voice of our artist’s inspiration, above the static. In practicing reading deprivation, we need to cast a watchful eye on these other pollutants. They poison the well. Take the next 7 days off from reading and outside chatter.

## Forbidden Joys, An Exercise

### Week 5: Recovering a Sense of Possibility

One of the favored tricks of blocked creatives is saying no to ourselves. It is astonishing the number of small ways we discover to be mean and miserly with ourselves. When I say this to my students. they often protest that this is not true — that they are very good to themselves. Then I ask them to do this exercise. List ten things you love and would love to do but are not allowed to do. Your list might look like this:

Go dancing. Carry a sketchbook. Roller-skate. Buy new cowboy boots. Streak your hair blond. Go on vacation. Take flying lessons. Move to a bigger place. Direct a play. Take life-drawing class.

Very often, the mere act of writing out your list of forbidden joys breaks down your barriers to doing them. Post your list somewhere highly visible.

## Wish List, An Exercise

### Week 5: Recovering a Sense of Possibility

One of the best ways we can evade our Censor is to use the technique of speed writing. Because wishes are just wishes. they are allowed to be frivolous (and frequently should be taken very seriously). As quickly as you can. finish the following phrases.

On paper, make your jealousy map.

## Archeology, An Exercise

### Week 7: Recovering a Sense of Connection

The phrases that follow are more of your sleuth work. Very often. we have buried parts of ourselves that can be uncovered by some digging.

## Listen

### Week 7: Recovering a Sense of Connection

Give yourself time out to listen to one side of an album, just for joy. You may want to doodle as you listen, allowing yourself to draw the shapes, emotions, and thoughts you hear in the music. Notice how just twenty minutes can refresh you. Learn to take these mini – artist dates to break stress and allow insight.

## Sacred Space

### Week 7: Recovering a Sense of Connection

Take yourself into a sacred space--a church, synagogue, library, grove of trees--and allow yourself to savor the silence and healing solitude. Each of us has a personal idea of what sacred space is. For me, a large clock store or a great aquarium store can engender a sense of timeless wonder. Experiment.

Create one wonderful smell in your house--with soup, incense, fir branches, candles--whatever.

<!-- Week 8 -->

## Goal Search

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

You may find the following exercise difficult. Allow yourself to do it anyway. If multiple dreams occur to you. do the exercise for each one of them. The simple act of imagining a dream in concrete detail helps us to bring it into reality. Think of your goal search as a preliminary architect’s drawing for the life you would wish to have. I am indebted to Barbara Sher and Shakti Gawain for the inspiration for these tasks.

The Steps

- Name your dream. That’s right. Write it down. “ In a perfect world. I would secretly love to be a ...”
- Name one concrete goal that signals to you its accomplishment. On your emotional compass. this goal signifies true north.
- In a perfect world. where would you like to be in five years in relation to your dream and true north?
- In the world we inhabit now, what action can you take, this year, to move you closer?
- What action can you take this month? This week? This day? Right now?
- List your dream (for example, to be a famous film director). List its true north (respect and higher consciousness. mass communication.) Select a role model (Walt Disney. Ron Howard. Michael Powell). Make an action plan. Five years. Three years. One year. One month. One week. Now. Choose an action. Reading this book is an action.

## New Childhood

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

What might you have been if you’d had perfect nurturing? Write a page of this fantasy childhood. What were you given? Can you reparent yourself in that direction now?

## Color Schemes

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

Pick a color and write a quick few sentences describing yourself in the first person. (“I am silver, high-tech and ethereal, the color of dreams and accomplishment, the color of half-light and in between, I feel serene.” Or “I am red. I am passion, sunset, anger, blood, wine and roses, armies, murder, lust, and apples.” What is your favorite color? What do you have that is that color? What about an entire room? This is your life and your house.

## Gain Disguised as Loss

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

Meditate on a loss you have faced. “Gain disguised as loss” is a potent artist’s tool. To acquire it, simply, brutally, ask: “How can this loss serve me? Where does it point my work?” The answers will surprise and liberate you.

## Dance it Out

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

List five things you are not allowed to do kill your boss, scream in church, go outside naked, make a scene, quit your job. Now do that thing on paper. Write it, draw it, paint it, act it out, collage it. Now put some music on and dance it.

## Style Search

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

List twenty things you like to do. Answer these questions for each item: Does it cost money or is it free? Expensive or cheap? Alone or with somebody? Job related? Physical risk? Fast-paced or slow? Mind, body, or spiritual?

## Ideal Day

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

Plan a perfect day in your life as it is now constituted.

## Ideal Ideal Day

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

Plan a perfect day in your life as you wish it were constituted. There are no restrictions. Allow yourself to be and to have whatever your heart desires. Your ideal environment, job, home, circle of friends, intimate relationship, stature in your art form--your wildest dreams.

## Ideal Day

### Week 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength

Image your ideal day and choose one festive aspect. Allow yourself to live it. You may not be able to move to Rome yet. but even in a still-grungy apartment you can enjoy a homemade cappuccino and a croissant.

<!-- Week 9 -->

## Blasting through Blocks

### Week 9: Recovering a Sense of Compassion

In order to work freely on a project. an artist must be at least functionally free of resentment (anger) and resistance (fear). A word of warning: this is a very powerful exercise ; it can do fatal damage to a creative block .

- List any resentments (anger) you have in connection with this project. It does not matter how petty. picky. or irrational these resentments may appear to your adult self. To your artist child they are real big deals: grudges. Some examples: I resent being the second artist asked. not the first. (I am too the best.). .. I resent this editor. she just nitpicks….
- Ask your artist to list any and all fears about the projected piece of work and / or anyone connected to it. What matters is that they are big scary monsters to your artist. Some examples: I’m afraid the work will be rotten and I won’t know it... I’m afraid the work will be good and they won’t know it... I’m afraid my ideas are ahead of their time… Get it out on the page.
- Ask yourself what you stand to gain by not doing this piece of work. Some examples: If I don’t write the piece. no one can hate it... If I don’t write the piece, my jerk editor will worry... If I don’t paint, sculpt, act, sing, dance, I can criticize others knowing I could do better.
- Make your deal. The deal is: “Okay, Creative Force, you take care of the quality, I’ll take care of the quantity.” Sign your deal and post it.

## Read your morning pages!

### Week 9: Recovering a Sense of Compassion

Read your morning pages! This process is best undertaken with two colored markers. one
to highlight insights and another to highlight actions needed. Do not judge your pages or
yourself. This is very important. Yes, they will be boring. Yes, they may be painful.
Consider them a map. Take them as information, not an indictment.

- Take Stock: Who have you consistently been complaining about? What have you
  procrastinated on? What blessedly have you allowed yourself to change or
